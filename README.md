# Tic-Tac-Toe
This game is designed with win detectors to create the best possible user experience. Essentially, what I did was turn the board into a list, which would have numbers in order with each other. In Python, it is not too easy to have a great graphical experence, as Python can't render that. We used keyboard text to create the Board. In a nutshell, using lists were essential. Lists also increase efficency in the code, which was I tried to strive for. I recommend using lists in your projects, as they increase efficency. It's an easy game to make, it just takes time. Just go onto the code and try it out on whatever you code on, from ReplIt to Visual Studio Code. Thanks for reading this, and I hope you like the game.
